=head1 NAME

Interoperability Chart for Crypt::RSA.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Crpyt::RSA <--> Other Cryptography Software

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Crypt::RSA interoperability chart. It contains names and
versions of cryptographic applications/libraries that are known to work
with Crypt::RSA. Wherever possible, a mapping from Crypt::RSA methods
to compatible methods/functions from the external library/application
is provided.

If you happen to get a library/application to play nicely with Crypt::RSA,
please fill out crypt-rsa-interoperability-template(3) and send it in for
inclusion in this chart.
