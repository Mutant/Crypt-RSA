README for Crypt::RSA

Introduction

    Crypt::RSA is a pure-perl, cleanroom implementation of the RSA
    public-key cryptosystem. It uses Math::Pari(3), a perl interface to the
    blazingly fast PARI library, for big integer arithmetic and number
    theoretic computations.

    Crypt::RSA provides arbitrary size key-pair generation, plaintext-aware
    encryption (OAEP) and digital signatures with appendix (PSS). For
    compatibility with SSLv3, RSAREF2, PGP and other applications that
    follow the PKCS #1 v1.5 standard, it also provides PKCS #1 v1.5
    encryption and signatures.

Documentation

    Crypt::RSA has extensive POD documentation. Start at 

        "perldoc lib/Crypt/RSA.pm"
     or "perldoc Crypt::RSA"

Stability 

    Crypt::RSA is considered to be stable, production
    quality code.
